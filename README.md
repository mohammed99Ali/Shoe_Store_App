**[Negozio Shoe Store App] - Final Project for Developing Android Apps with Kotlin - Part 1**

This is the final project for the "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin - Part 1" course offered by Android Kotlin Developer from Udacity. It demonstrates the use of Kotlin for building an Android application.
This is my first Android app using Kotlin. Italian Shoe Store App!! So, it is a simple app to order a shoe with specific customization. It has 7 fragments starting from the Welcome Screen ending with either saving your design or share it with a dealer or a friend. The App's Idea was suggested by the course team to use me experience from using the linear Layout. I built it with multi-screen application method among a lot of wonderful methodologies to build the app.


**Tour in the app** ‚ú® 

**Get Started** 
	In your first tour in the app, you will see the login screen asking you for the user information. 
Note that the functionality for the sign-up and login isn‚Äôt implemented correctly,
because of the learning journey the course team asked us to focus on the designing (among the main functionalities for the app to work correctly). 
After you entered the required info‚Äôs, you won‚Äôt see the order area yet, you must walk through the welcome & instruction screens.
The instruction screen is a simple screen to guide you how to deal with the app correctly. 

**Order And Customization** 
	Now you will start your ordering trip. After clicking the ‚Äúnew order button‚Äù in the bottom right corner of the order list screen the order screen will show up.
Now you can customize your shoe‚Ä¶ first you must enter Your name, Gender and the size of the shoe. Among selecting the Brand, Type, Material and color (you can enter any color you have).
Then you‚Äôll preview the order. If you want to change something you can click cancel. 
If you‚Äôre good with the order but you want for some reason to save your order for later uses you can click save. 
Now here is the triggering area. For this app to be real app and can be a useful app. You can share it with shop that can provide you with your custom shoe. 
Maybe its not useful and a great way to order a shoe. And I ‚Äòll agree with you, because the idea of the app is not to build a real app for a shop shoe. 
The idea of the app is to give the project reviewer a look of what my experience in design will build. 

**Sharing an Order** 
when finally saved an order or you still in the review area you can click share button. That will give you the access to view your order on some social media platform. 
You may send it via WhatsApp or email. The order will be sent in text form heading with the username that you choose in the login screen. 
Then your shoe customization came next. Finally, as a beauty touch the text will end with the store slogan ‚ÄúYou are not buying an object, you are buying a style‚Äù


**Features üìù**
*So, as I said this is not a real app but I will write some features that I believe it can be at least a feature 
		-Simple app: the language of the app is set to be clear for the user to understand, you can understand the app from reading the instruction only.
		-Side menu: away for you to access the login page, about page and instruction page from the side menu.
		-simple design: you can order and share your order within five minutes (if you had a clue for what shoe you are searching for), able to send the order via modern social media apps.


**#Technologies I Used in my project**
		-	ViewModel and LiveData lifecycle
		-	Single Activity architecture
		-	ViewGroups and Views
		-	Databinding 
		-	multi-screened Android Application
		-	ScrollView 
		-	Navigation using KTX 

**# The core Android development concepts I used in My project**
	‚Ä¢	Activities 
		-	Main Activity: the main Activity that holds the app logic within the single Activity method
	‚Ä¢	Fragments 
		-	Login: first fragment and the one how responsible for holding the login function (not working as it should)
		-	Instruction: responsible for guide the user through the app
		-	About: responsible for displays information about your app
		-	Welcome: just saying welcome 
		-	Order lest: responsible for holding the orders, you can share & edit existing order from here
		-	Order: customize your order here
		-	Preview: edit, share and save an order
	‚Ä¢	UI Elements:
		-	TextViews and Image Views to show the app
		-	Buttons, ImageButtons and ScrollView to control the app
		-	EditTexts and RadioGroups to take input 
	‚Ä¢	Data Handling: The app doesn‚Äôt contain any database. But it can handle the shutdown process. 

**#The Main Libraries and Dependencies**
		-	Androidx : databinding, navigation(KTX), lifecycle, appcompat

**Contribution**
This repo doesn‚Äôt have future purposes. But I‚Äôll continue developing it just for learning purposes. So, if you want to contribute anything you find useful, Thank you in advance.
